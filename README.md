#MOVE.C

A small game, as an introduction for myself into this sort of programming software

__TODO:__ 
          -Add dynamic map size
          -Add more maps
          -Add something to do :/
          -Add map traversal
          -Add gameplay
          
The gameplay is nothing really extraordinary at the moment but future commits will be to change that
